   * New upstream version
     + replaces the expiration call mechanism and script with native
       implementation (closes: 794328)
   * Changed error log rotation schedule to daily execution (to expire some
     cruft from ancient bugs sooner or later)
   * removed urlencode-fixer.pl (should be obsolete now), expire-caller.pl
     (symlink to acngtool which emulates it)
