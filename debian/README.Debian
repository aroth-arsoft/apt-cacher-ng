apt-cacher-ng for Debian
------------------------

See apt-cacher-ng.pdf for configuration instructions (or HTML version or
README). A sample configuration file for the clients is provided in
/usr/share/doc/apt-cacher-ng/examples/000apt-cacher-ng-proxy.

The configuration directory on Debian systems is located in
/etc/apt-cacher-ng/. By default, it contains three configuration files:

 * acng.conf (main configuration file shipped with the package)
 * security.conf (a file containing sensitive data like passwords)
 * zz_debconf.conf (a generated file with basic settings from the package setup)

It's recommended to put special local settings of configuration variables into
a custom file interpreted after acng.conf but before zz_debconf.conf, like
/etc/apt-cacher-ng/local.conf . If configured this way, the acng.conf file
might be replaced with the default version (acng.conf.dpkg-dist) to simplify
its handling in future.

The logs are stored in /var/log/apt-cacher-ng/ and are expired by logrotate
except for temporary maintenance logs which are removed automatically. The
access mode of /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf is explicitly changed to
restrict access to members of the apt-cacher-ng group.

REMOTE MIRROR CONFIGURATION
---------------------------

The Debian setup comes with a semi-automated backend configuration. The
remapping rules for many known mirrors are shipped with the package. On
installation, the setup script picks up a list of preferred backend hosts from
local machine's current sources.list files and puts them into
/etc/apt-cacher-ng/backends_* files.

To change the mirrors used by apt-cacher-ng, user needs to add/remove/reorder
the lists in this backends files. To execute or enable automatic configuration,
run "dpkg-reconfigure apt-cacher-ng".

INETD USAGE
-----------

For inetd usage, the in.acng binary is shipped with the Debian package.
However, it needs to be installed manually by adding the line:

3142  stream  tcp nowait  apt-cacher-ng /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/in.acng /var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket

to /etc/inetd.conf and reload of the inetd daemon. The parameters above need to
be adapted as needed, also see the package documentation for more details.

NOTE: this inetd bridge is not required in order to set ACLs via /etc/host.*
files. Recent versions of apt-cacher-ng support these access filters natively.
